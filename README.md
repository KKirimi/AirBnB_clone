The goal of the project is to deploy on our server a simple copy of the AirBnB website. The complete web applicationwill be composed by:
	1. A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface (perfect for development and debugging)
	2. A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic.
	3. A database or files that store data (data = objects)
	4. An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them).


The first step towards building the full web application: the AirBnB clone is to write a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects. The console:
	1. Creates the data model
	2. Manages (creates, updates, destroys, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
	3. Stores and persists objects to a file (JSON file)

 In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:
	1. Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
	2. Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc ...
	3. Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc...)
	4. Update attributes of an object
	5. Destroy an object
